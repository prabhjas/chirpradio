# User Story #

As a Volunteer I want to login and see a list of tasks that I have committed to.

Work is tracked on [Issue 16](https://code.google.com/p/chirpradio/issues/detail?id=16)

VolunteersCanClaimTasks defines the process of claiming tasks, which is different.

In its simplest form, the list of tasks could look like this:

```
4/18 Tabling from 12pm - 2pm (3 volunteers needed)
4/18 Tabling from 2pm - 4pm (2 volunteers needed)
...etc...
```

However, this ticket is to address task signup at the record fair.  So once the event-based work has been done, the task list should be listed per event (record fair), per day, per shift in chronological order.
