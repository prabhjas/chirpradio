# Introduction #

All CHIRP volunteers are required to put in time in order to be part of the organization.  To be an on-air DJ one has to put in more time.  Points are earned per volunteer task completed and per CHIRP meeting attended.


# How The Point System Works #

Volunteer hours are currently tracked as points, typically one point per hour but a point might not always equal one hour.  The volunteer coordinator creates tasks in the Volunteer Tracker website and assigns a potential number of points that will be earned by completing that task.  When a volunteer completes the task and it is marked as such in the system then the volunteer earns the potential number of points.

Here are some examples of tasks:

  * DJing at the Renegrade Craft Fair
  * Selling merch at the Pitchfork festival
  * Reviewed CD for profanity.

# Tally of Points #

A volunteer coordinator can use the Tracker website to request a CSV file that tallies all earned points per volunteer since the 1st of some month that she selects from a dropdown.  As an example, let's say you want all points earned since July 1st, here is how the tally is calculated:

  * Query all tasks per volunteer that were marked as **completed** on or after July 1st and add up the points.  Note that this has nothing to do with when the actual task was performed or when the event occurred.  Tasks are marked as complete by the coordinator within a month after each event but usually sooner.
  * Query all meetings attended on or after July 1st and add one point per meeting.  The actual date of the meeting is used for this query.
