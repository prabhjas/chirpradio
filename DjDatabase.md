# CHIRP DJ Database #

CHIRP DJs need access to a database of what's available in our music library.  This will probably be a website and will be populated by parsing and importing (and cleaning up) mp3 tags from the digital library.  Here are some other ideas for features and things we might need to develop software for :

  * Allow DJs to review albums so that others have some insight into what's good and what's not
  * Keep track of which songs contain profanity and other FCC violations
  * Allow DJs to create playlists that they later might perform live on the air
  * Import profanity information from Tony's CSV file (from WLUW)
  * Also import DJ reviews from Tony's CSV when the DJ is a CHIRP member or has given us permission to use her review.
